However, it has taken into account, the varying levels of access to such tools-Mobile, Radio, Television, SMS, and various social media.</p>
            <p class="content">Pokhriyal further added that the fact that many of us may not have internet facility in the mobile, or may not be able to use different social media tools- such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Google, etc., the calendar guides teachers to further guide parents and students through SMS on mobile phones or through voice call.</p>

            <p class="content">Pokhriyal highlighted that the calendar contains a week-wise plan consisting of interesting and challenging activities, with reference to theme/chapter taken from syllabus or textbook. Most importantly, it maps the themes with the learning outcomes. The purpose of mapping of themes with learning outcomes is to facilitate teachers/parents to assess the progress in the learning of children and also to go beyond textbooks. </p>
            <p class="content">HRD Minister said that the activities given in the calendar focus on learning outcomes and can thus be achieved through any resource including the textbooks children are using in their states or UTs.</p>

            <p class="content">He further informed that this calendar also gives space to the strategies of reducing stress and anxiety among teachers, students, and parents. The calendar includes a link for chapter wise e-content available on the e-pathshala, NROER, and DIKSHA portal of Government of India</p>
            <p class="content">All the given activities are suggestive in nature, not prescriptive, nor is the sequence mandatory. Teachers and parents may opt to contextualize the activities and do those activities that the student shows interest in, irrespective of the sequence.</p>
